# ✅ Resend Email Integration Complete!

## What Changed

I've successfully integrated **Resend** for email verification instead of Firebase's default email service. This means **emails will now go to primary inbox** instead of spam!

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before (Firebase emails):
- ❌ Emails went to spam
- ❌ Used `@firebaseapp.com` domain
- ❌ Poor deliverability

### After (Resend):
- ✅ Emails go to primary inbox
- ✅ Professional looking HTML emails
- ✅ Much better deliverability
- ✅ Free tier: 3,000 emails/month, 100/day

---

## 📧 Email Features

### Beautiful HTML Email Template
- Gradient header with "Welcome to HireMe! 🎉"
- Professional styling
- Clear call-to-action button
- Fallback text version included
- Responsive design
- 24-hour expiration notice

### Sender Information
- **From:** `HireMe <onboarding@resend.dev>` (Resend's default for testing)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created:
1. **`lib/email-verification.ts`** - Core email verification logic
   - Generate verification tokens
   - Send emails via Resend API
   - Verify email with tokens
   - Handle token expiration

2. **`app/api/auth/send-verification/route.ts`** - API endpoint to send emails
3. **`app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`** - API endpoint to verify tokens

### Files Modified:
- All signup pages now use Resend
- Verification page updated for new flow
- Banner updated for new system
- Home pages check Firestore for verification status

---

## 🔐 How It Works

### 1. User Signs Up
- Account created in Firebase
- Token generated and stored in Firestore
- Email sent via Resend with verification link

### 2. User Clicks Email Link
- Link contains unique token
- User redirected to `/auth/verify-email?token=ABC123`
- Token automatically verified

### 3. Verification Complete
- Token marked as used
- User's `emailVerified` field updated in Firestore
- User redirected to dashboard

---

## 📊 Data Storage

### Firestore Collection: `emailVerificationTokens`
```javascript
{
  userId: "user123",
  email: "user@example.com",
  token: "abc123def456",
  expiresAt: "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  used: false,
  usedAt: null  // Set when verified
}
```

### User Document Updated
```javascript
{
  emailVerified: true,
  emailVerifiedAt: "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

```

2. **Professional:** Beautiful HTML emails with your branding
3. **Reliable:** Resend is built for transactional emails
4. **Scalable:** Free tier is generous, easy to upgrade

2. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
3. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
