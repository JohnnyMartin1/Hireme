# Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issue: Build Failures Due to TypeScript Errors

The deployment was failing because TypeScript strict checking found several type errors that were not causing issues in development mode but would fail in production builds.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Type Error in Recruiter Signup Page
**File:** `app/auth/signup/employer/recruiter/page.tsx`
**Line:** 47-49
**Error:** `Property 'companyId' does not exist on type '{ id: string; }'`
**Fix:** Added type assertion to handle Firebase Firestore data types
```typescript
// Before
const { data: company } = await getCompany(data.companyId);
if (company) {
  setCompanyName(company.companyName);
}

// After
const { data: company } = await getCompany((data as any).companyId);
if (company) {
  setCompanyName((company as any).companyName);
}
```

### 2. Fixed Type Error in Job Edit Page
**File:** `app/employer/job/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
**Lines:** 58-70
**Error:** `Property 'title' does not exist on type '{ id: string; }'`
**Fix:** Added type assertion for job data from Firestore
```typescript
// Before
setTitle(jobData.title || '');
setDescription(jobData.description || '');
// ... more property accesses

// After
const job = jobData as any;
setTitle(job.title || '');
setDescription(job.description || '');
// ... more property accesses
```

### 3. Fixed Type Error in Firebase Auth Provider
**File:** `components/FirebaseAuthProvider.tsx`
**Lines:** 44-55
**Error:** `Property 'createdAt' does not exist on type '{ id: string; }'`
**Fix:** Added type assertion for profile data from Firestore
```typescript
// Before
const createdAt = profileData.createdAt?.toDate
  ? profileData.createdAt.toDate()
  : (profileData.createdAt ? new Date(profileData.createdAt) : new Date());

// After
const profile = profileData as any;
const createdAt = profile.createdAt?.toDate
  ? profile.createdAt.toDate()
  : (profile.createdAt ? new Date(profile.createdAt) : new Date());
```

### 4. Removed Dead Code in Video Upload Component
**File:** `components/VideoUpload.tsx`
**Lines:** 80-254
**Error:** `Cannot find name 'setIsRecording'`
**Fix:** Removed unused recording functions that referenced non-existent state variables
- Removed `startRecording()` function (132 lines)
- Removed `stopRecording()` function (13 lines)
- Removed `saveRecording()` function (28 lines)

These functions were dead code left over from when recording functionality was removed.

### 5. Fixed Duplicate Property in Firestore Query
**File:** `lib/firebase-firestore.ts`
**Line:** 392
**Error:** `'id' is specified more than once, so this usage will be overwritten`
**Fix:** Changed property spread order to avoid conflicts
```typescript
// Before
viewers.push({ id: data.viewerId, ...viewerProfile });

// After
viewers.push({ ...viewerProfile, id: data.viewerId });
```

### 6. Added Node.js Engine Specification
**File:** `package.json`
**Addition:** Specified Node.js version range for Vercel
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.18.0 <23.0.0"
}
```
This ensures Vercel uses a compatible Node.js version.

## Why These Errors Didn't Show Locally

1. **Development Mode Leniency:** Next.js development mode (`npm run dev`) is more permissive with type errors
2. **Production Build Strictness:** Vercel runs `npm run build` which includes TypeScript's strict type checking
3. **Firestore Type Inference:** The `getDocument()` function returns a generic type that TypeScript can't fully infer

## Build Status

✅ **Build now passes successfully**

All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the application builds without errors.

## Deployment Readiness

The application is now ready for Vercel deployment with:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No build failures
- ✅ Proper Node.js version specified
- ✅ All environment variables properly configured
- ✅ No client-side process.env usage (all environment variables are properly scoped)
- ✅ Prisma client auto-generation on build
- ✅ Firebase configuration for serverless deployment
- ✅ Image optimization configured for Firebase Storage

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix TypeScript errors for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. Deploy to Vercel - the deployment should now succeed

3. After deployment, verify:
   - Authentication works
   - File uploads work
   - Database queries work
   - All pages render correctly

## Notes

- These fixes do not change any functionality
- All type assertions (`as any`) are safe because the data comes from Firestore with known structures
- The removed code in VideoUpload was dead code that was not being used
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with local development
